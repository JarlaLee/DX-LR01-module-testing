This is a test project of DX-LR01 module of DX-LR01 Technology in Bactria to verify the functions of Lora module. The project uses Arduino+Lora module as the data sender and Lora+PC test software as the data receiver. The data sender uses a software UART communication scheme by defining pins 10 and 11 as Rx, Tx. The project successfully tested the transparent transmission mode, fixed-point transmission mode and broadcast transmission mode of Lora module. At the same time, the project will provide experimental records and documents, and official data will be displayed in a connected way.
